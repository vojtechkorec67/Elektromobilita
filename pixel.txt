A pixel is represented by a dot or square on a computer monitor display screen. Pixels are the basic building blocks of
a digital image or display and are created using geometric coordinates. Depending on the graphics card and display monitor,
the quantity, size and color combination of pixels varies and is measured in terms of the display resolution.
For example, a computer with a display resolution of 1280 x 768 will produce a maximum of 98,3040 pixels on a display screen.
Each pixel has a unique logical address, a size of eight bits or more and, in most high-end display devices, the ability to project
millions of different colors.The pixel resolution spread also determines the quality of display; more pixels per inch of
monitor screen yields better image results.

Each of the pixels that represents an image stored inside a computer has a pixel value which describes how bright that pixel is,
and/or what color it should be. In the simplest case of binary images, the pixel value is a 1-bit number indicating either
foreground or background. For a grayscale images, the pixel value is a single number that represents the brightness of the pixel.
The most common pixel format is the byte image, where this number is stored as an 8-bit integer giving a range of possible values
from 0 to 255. Typically zero is taken to be black, and 255 is taken to be white. Values in between make up the different shades
of gray.
